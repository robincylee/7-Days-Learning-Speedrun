# Story Telling
As an inspired coder that never stop on exploring and learning new technologies. I tend to find that it is hard to stay committed in a long learning journey. Hence, I'm dedicated to discovering my own learning methodology to help me in learning and ideally the learning period should be short. After some experiment, I discovered that doing a 7 days quick study gives me a better learning result, simultaneously overcome the fatigue of a long commitment. Based on the finding, I continue to develop a set of principles to enhance my learning experience. I also created this repo to keep track of my journal and the results.

## Principle of Speedrun Learning:

1.  Set a topic of interest. Stick to the scope.
2.  Abuse the speed. The point of speedrun learning is to remember as much knowledge/concept as possible in given period.
3. Develop a simple project with the knowledge/concept. Learning is a cognitive process of interpreting message and produce response that resemble the interpreted message.
4. Identify Learning traps. Clearly with speed abuse, learning accuracy will be dropping drastically and result in losing interest after several failed attempts. Thus, to maintain the learning integrity, always abstract complex subject from topic of interest and put it in separate speedrun.
5. Rate the learning at the end. This helps on estimating the time needed to go deeper into the subjects in the future.
